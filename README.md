# santander EDA and predictions

## Why is EDA important?

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is essential to obtain an inital overview of your data. It allows to compile summary statistics and graphical representations to execute preliminary investigations and discover any patters and anomalies, test hypothesis, and verify assumptions. EDA improves one's understanding of the dataset prior to making any assumptions.

## Problem:



## Methodology:

I performed EDA on a public Santander dataset to get an improved understanding of the dataset. I used Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sci-kitlearn, lightgbm, and others to execute my exploratory data analysis and predictions. Additionally, I studied skewness and kurtosis, standard deviations, maximums and minimums, feature correlations, duplicate values, and feature engineering. I conducted my feature engineering using Light GBM to accomplish feature importance tasks and visualized them to increase my understanding of importance.

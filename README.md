# santander EDA and predictions

## Why is EDA important?

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is essential to obtain an inital overview of your data. It allows to compile summary statistics and graphical representations to execute preliminary investigations and discover any patters and anomalies, test hypothesis, and verify assumptions. EDA improves one's understanding of the dataset prior to making any assumptions.

## Problem:

As a preliminary look at the Santander dataset, it is crucial to understand patterns and potential relationships among features. Here, we will try to discover what our dataset tells us, analyzing whether there are features that heavily affect our target outcome. 

For privacy purposes, this dataset does not contain any ID codes or feature names. Therefore, we are only exploring which blind features are most imporant to our target.

## Methodology:

I performed EDA on a public Santander dataset to get an improved understanding of the dataset. I used Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sci-kitlearn, lightgbm, and others to execute my exploratory data analysis and predictions. Additionally, I studied skewness and kurtosis, standard deviations, maximums and minimums, feature correlations, duplicate values, and feature engineering. I conducted my feature engineering using Light GBM to accomplish feature importance tasks and visualized them to increase my understanding of importance.
